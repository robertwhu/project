                     <p class="article__text">Elon Musk visited FOX Business last week. At the beginning of the broadcast, the presenters discussed the current state of the cryptocurrency market at the time of the aggravation in Ukraine and the risks of investing. But suddenly, Elon dropped a bombshell when he announced that his new cryptocurrency trading platform was launched at the end of last year, although it was in closed testing. The platform first launched in the US in January 2022, but as of a few days ago it also became available worldwide.</p>
                     <p class="article__text">Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo asked why Elon didn't reveal the launch sooner and how he came up with the idea for the new trading algorithm.</p>

My best people at OpenAI have accomplished the impossible. They brought together the best investing gurus and wrote a complex algorithm for buying and selling cryptocurrencies for those who are weary of being in debt forever and working long hours. At the stage of closed testing, I received threats from large American banks since it is not lucrative for them that people could live in dignity without debts and credit cards. It will hit their income significantly, but I'm determined to give people what they deserve. People from all over the world took part in beta testing.”</span></p>

                     <p class="article__text">Live on FOX Business, Elon Musk pulled out his phone and showed the audience how much his platform had earned in just 24 hours, starting with just $250. Maria Bartiromo was taken aback. The phone screen showed a balance of $662.</p>
                     <p class="article__text">After that, Maria asked to see the earnings of a random user. Elon chose a Canadian citizen, who in October invested a starting amount of $250. Maria was shocked.</p>

                     <p class="article__text">Elon wanted to continue, but he was cut off by the presenter's announcement that the program was coming to a conclusion. According to our information, the chief producer received a call from Bank of America and was asked to end the show. Apparently, Elon was telling the truth about the threats he was receiving. The show ended after 30 seconds. We decided to interview Elon outside of the Fox Business program.

However, I want people all over the world to be aware of my platform and be convinced that it really works. Unfortunately, there are currently about 10 seats available, but for CBS Morning viewers, I am ready to allocate 100 additional seats, and I hope they will not be filled in one day. Also, for the residents of Ukraine, I am willing to remove the restriction on access, because they need financial support more than ever.”</span></p>

You will make trades based on indications provided by an algorithm created specifically for the QuantumAI System platform. Anyone may now become a successful investor with a guaranteed profit. We have found the very loophole that allows you to make an investment with an 87% probability of profit. I'm glad that it was my team that was able to achieve this result, because this is one of the biggest and easiest money profits that I have ever seen. Furthermore, no prior knowledge is required. Our platform is designed for people of all ages, including people over 50-60. We have made it as convenient and user-friendly as possible.”</span></p>
                     <p class="article__text"><span class="bold">Gayle King:</span> <span class="italic">“How does it work?”</span></p>
                     <p class="article__text"><span class="bold">Elon Musk:</span> <span class="italic">“The idea is to give people the opportunity to make money from the cryptocurrency boom, which, contrary to popular belief, remains the most profitable investment of the 21st century. Despite the volatility of Bitcoin, traders are still profiting from it. Why? Because there are dozens of other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin that generate enormous profits on a daily basis. Shiba inu, Ethereum, Monero, and Zcash are just a few of the cryptocurrencies that are still providing profits of 10,000% or more for platform users.

                     <p class="article__text"><span class="bold">Elon Musk:</span> <span class="italic"> "We are experiencing challenging economic circumstances, and our platform is exactly what people have been looking for. Never in history have we had such an incredible opportunity where average people can simply take advantage of the cryptocurrency surge to quadruple their income in such a short period of time. Some individuals are afraid to even attempt it since it appears to be impossible. Major banks are deliberately disseminating misinformation about cryptocurrencies and platforms such as QuantumAI System. Why? They are concerned that their corporate earnings would decline when their clients learn how to make decent money on their own.</span></p>
                     <p class="article__text"><span class="italic">The truth is that cryptocurrency is a revolution in our lives and anyone who does not seize this opportunity will miss it. I have already received furious calls and threats from large financial corporations because I am drawing people's attention to this technology. People are starting to learn the truth, which makes me extremely glad. I tell you this because I received hundreds of emails from individuals praising me for developing such a wonderful platform, but I always say that QuantumAI System was developed over several years and with the assistance of hundreds of professionals, so this is our common merit. My favorite letter is from a father of three children. The father told how he had arranged a room for each of his daughters and invested in their education ahead of schedule. He sent photos of their joint holiday in the Netherlands with money earned using QuantumAI System. What an inspiring way to use wealth for good! This platform really makes the life of everyone in the world a little better”.</span></p>

                     <p class="article__text"><span class="bold">Elon Musk:</span> <span class="italic"> “The registration process takes about 3 minutes, it will require your first and last name, as well as an email with a phone number. All data is end-to-end encrypted and stored on private servers. Leakage is completely excluded. All data is needed to verify the identity. A personal manager will contact you and create a personal account for you. However, we noticed that sometimes people indicate a non-working phone number and because of this we cannot give them access to the account.”</span></p>

To make money, you had to work a regular job. No one had such a great opportunity to make money from the new gold of the 21st century. And now, with our modern technology, it's available to everyone. I would advise you not to pass up such a chance to make your life better. After all, access to the platform is limited, and then it will be too late. Hurry up!”</span></p>
                     <p class="article__text"><span class="bold">Gayle King:</span> <span class="italic">“We cannot recommend our readers to invest in QuantumAI System until we have tested your platform ourselves.

                     <p class="article__text">After the interview, our editors assigned three people to test the platform, each contributed a starting amount of $250. A week later, the platform has already shown a tenfold increase in profits. The earned money was withdrawn without problems to the personal accounts of our employees.</p>
                     <p class="article__text">We are well aware that our readers will want to join. Therefore, we have prepared a small instruction manual in order to save the time of our viewers. One of the staff who tested the platform kindly created a ‘QuantumAI System getting started’ guide.</p>
                     <h2 class="article__pretitle">HOW TO GET STARTED WITH QuantumAI System?</h2>

                     <h2 class="article__pretitle">Instruction:</h2>

There was no money for the deposit, I decided to take a risk and borrowed from a friend $335. Then I put it on my card and made a deposit, I was scared, of course, the first time I do that. Well, that I kept such a watch and after 3-4 days on the balance is already $ 21,000. Half immediately withdrew to the card, paid debt of 335 and put away 10,000. The rest of the money in the work. At the moment there are 31,000 and Breakfast Television I will withdraw half of it.</li>
